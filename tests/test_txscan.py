"""Tree-wide CAN-TX allow-list scan — the Phase 3 carve-out, enforced in
code (GPS-Integration TODO: "evolve the AST scan from 'no TX anywhere' to
a positive allow-list of TX-permitted modules").

The scope constraint it makes executable: diagnostics only, with exactly
two named TX exceptions — (1) link-layer heartbeat/reply behavior required
by bus participation (lives in CanTick firmware, not in this tree), and
(2) the GNSS source node `n2k/node.py` (address claim, claim defense, ISO
request responses, the five GNSS PGNs), started and stopped only by an
explicit user action. Any send-shaped call on a socket in ANY other module
hard-fails the build; modules that legitimately speak non-CAN sockets are
each named with their justification. The per-module RX-only scans in
tests/test_busmon.py / test_n2k.py remain as the independent reject pass.
