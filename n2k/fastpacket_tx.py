"""NMEA2000 fast-packet TX framing — first outbound fast-packet in the
ecosystem (129029 GNSS Position Data needs it; Wio Terminal Island will
want this again, so it is a standalone, socket-free module).

The framing mirrors what kilodash/n2k.py::FastPacketAssembler reassembles:

    frame 0:  [seq<<5 | 0] [total_len] [payload bytes 0..5]
    frame n:  [seq<<5 | n] [payload bytes 6+7(n-1) .. +7]

seq is a 3-bit counter (bits 5-7) that must CHANGE between consecutive
messages of the same (PGN, source) so a receiver can tell a restarted
sequence from a continuation; frames are always padded to 8 bytes with
0xFF. Max assembled payload 223 bytes (0..5 + 31*7).

The round-trip test (tests/test_n2knode.py) runs this splitter against
our own RX reassembler — the two independent implementations validate
each other, which also hardens the RX side with a second real producer.
